## Lineare Gleichung

A linear equation has the following form :

a1x1+a2x2+⋯+anxn=b(1)

In (1), $ai$ are called the coefficients and xi

are called the variables (also called unknowns).
Example I

(2)

is a linear equation.

2–√x−34y=−12(2)

Example II

(3)

is not a linear equation.

2x3+−5y=1(3)


# Lineares System

A linear system (also called system of linear equations) gathers several linear equations which are related to each other.

There are many methods for solving such systems. We are going to see the addition method only whose goal is to eliminate a variable by adding two equations.
Example III

{2x−4yx+2y==2−7(4)(5)


In order to eliminate a variable by adding (4)
and (5) together, we can for instance multiply them by 1 and −2, repectively. By doing so, we get (6) and (7)

.

(6)(7)(8)2x−4y−2x−4y−8y===21416

Let’s solve (8)

:

−8y=16⟺
y=−2

Let’s replace y
, for example in (5)

(it could be any other) :

x+2⋅−2y=−7⟺x−4=−7⟺
x=−3

Example IV

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪−x−3y+zx+y−3z3x+4y+2z===10−12−5(9)(10)(11)



Let’s eliminate x
by multiplying (9) by 1 and (10) by 1, and thus getting (12) and (13) (below left). Let’s one more time eliminate x by multiplying (10) by −3 and (11) by 1, and thus getting (15) and (16

) (below right).
(12)(13)(14)−x−3y+zx+y−3z−2y−2z===10−12−2
(15)(16)(17)−3x+−3y+9z3x+4y+2zy+11z===36−531


Let’s eliminate y
by multiplying (14) by 1 and (17) by 2. By doing so, we get (18) and (19)

.

(18)(19)(20)−2y−2z2y+22z20z===−26260

Let’s solve (20)

:

20z=60⟺
z=3

Let’s replace z
for example in (17)

:

y+11⋅3z=31⟺y+33=31⟺
y=−2

Let’s replace y
and z for example in (10)

(it could be any other) :

x+−2y−3⋅3z=−12⟺x+−11=−12⟺
x=−1

# Zusammenfassung

The point is to eliminate a variable by adding two equations together. For that purpose it is necessary to find the right factors. The addition generates a new equation which in turns can be used for the elimination of another variable.
